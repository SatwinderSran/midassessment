Program creates a list of done and undone tasks which can be displayed. The tasks are entered through input from '/s'.You can enter done and undone tasks. The undone tasks are added to the list of undone tasks which are displayed with  /list. When added to done tasks, the task is tken off of undone tasks and added to the list of done tasks which is displayed with '/done'. The front end is very minimal because I am not experienced with it and was planning to go to your office hours today before they got cancelled. The backend works fine and updates everything accordingly which is what i needed and did for my part of the project which was backend. I used connection pooling to accesss the datatbase and used a node server. Sorry this progress was so minimal, but I have finals going on and never really learned tricks to make frontend look advanced.
